# The Haskell Games

Haskell training repository

## Folder structure

Ideally, this repo will contain a couple of folders with haskell files inside, each folder for every learning resource (more or less).

```
# File tree
.giignore
LICENSE
README.md
- dir1/
    - file.hs
    - file2.hs
    - README for specific dir
- dir2/
    - file.hs
    - file2.hs
    - README for specific dir
[..]
# And so on
```

Probably linking those README's together is a good idea.
